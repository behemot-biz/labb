                    <!-- temp place holder text -->
                    <p>We call bokashi kitchen composting because most of it takes place indoors - in the kitchen. All you need to get started is a couple of buckets and a bag of bokashi "crumbles". There are special buckets, but it is fine to use your own.</p>
                </div>

                <div id="green-box">
                    <h2>What you need to start</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two 10l buckets with tight sealing lids</li>
                        <li>Bokashi "crumbles"</li>
                        <li>Storage for the buckets, min temp 15 c</li>
                        <li>Optional, a smaller bucket for your kitchen worksurface</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You also need somewhere to dig down the food when it's fermented.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="text">
                <p>It doesn't take you more than a couple of minutes a day to make bokashi - just fill the bucket with food scraps and sprinkle on some bokashi "crumbles". No sorting - everything goes in the bucket! Shrimp shells and minced meat, egg shells, lemon peels, coffee grounds and chicken bones. The microbes in the bokashi straw preserve the leftover food so that there is almost no smell in the bucket (slightly sour).</p>
                <p>But it is important that it gets quite dry in the bucket; if it gets wet it can start to smell, not rotten but sour. Therefore, you have a faucet in the bucket to drain it as you go or, if you use regular buckets, you alternate with newspaper to absorb the moisture.</p>
                <p>You need two buckets so you can fill one while the other stays warm indoors for a couple of weeks for post-fermentation. Then you are free to make soil!</p>

                <p>There will be no soil in the bucket itself. But as soon as you bury the fermented Bokashin in the soil, or mix it with soil in any other way, it starts to turn into soil.</p>
